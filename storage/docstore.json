For 400 years, settlers and immigrants have contributed to the diversity and richness of our country, which is built on a proud history and a strong identity.\nCanada is a constitutional monarchy, a\nparliamentary democracy and a federal state. Canadians are bound together by a shared commitment to the rule of law and to the institutions of parliamentary government.\nCanadians take pride in their identity and have \nmade sacrifices to defend their way of life. By coming to Canada and taking this important step toward Canadian citizenship, you are helping to write the continuing story of Canada.Immigrants between the ages of 18 and 54 must have adequate knowledge of English or French in order to become Canadian citizens. You must also learn about voting procedures, Canada\u2019s history, symbols, democratic institutions, geography, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\nCanadian citizens enjoy many rights, but \nCanadians also have responsibilities. They must obey Canada\u2019s laws and respect the rights and freedoms of others.\nThis guide will help you prepare to become a \nCanadian citizen. Good luck!\nFor information about Citizenship and \nImmigration Canada, visit our website atwww.cic.gc.ca.\nUnderstanding the Oath\nIn Canada, we profess our loyalty to a person who represents all Canadians and not to a document such as a constitution, a banner such as a flag, or a geopolitical entity such as a country.

The stock market crash of 1929, however, led to the Great Depression or the \u201cDirty Thirties.\u201d Unemployment reached 27% in 1933 and many businesses were wiped out. Farmers in Western Canada were hit hardest by low grain prices and a terrible drought.\nThere was growing demand for the government to \ncreate a social safety net with minimum wages, a standard work week and programs such as unemployment insurance. The Bank of Canada, a central bank to manage the money supply and bring stability to the financial system, was created in 1934. Immigration dropped and many refugees were turned away, including Jews trying to flee Nazi Germany in 1939.\nThe Se COND  WORlD WAR\nThe Second World War began in 1939 when Adolf \nHitler, the National Socialist (Nazi) dictator of Germany, invaded Poland and conquered much of Europe. Canada joined with its democratic allies in the fight to defeat tyranny by force of arms.\nMore than one million Canadians and \nNewfoundlanders (Newfoundland was a separate British entity) served in the Second World War, out of a population of 11.5 million. This was a high proportion and of these, 44,000 were killed.\nThe Canadians fought bravely and suffered \nlosses in the unsuccessful defence of Hong Kong (1941) from attack by Imperial Japan, and in a failed raid on Nazi-controlled Dieppe on the coast of France (1942).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2033, "end_char_idx": 4160, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "406c7bbc-8694-41ec-b177-3935a55a5608": {"__data__": {"id_": "406c7bbc-8694-41ec-b177-3935a55a5608", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "discover.pdf", "file_path": "discover.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11056931, "creation_date": "2024-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "36c20b98-7fdc-4c61-8520-57c9e0768cc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "discover.pdf", "file_path": "discover.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11056931, "creation_date": "2024-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-13"}, "hash": "944462339df24fa64226ea60094974d7d06a66ce18d8f94e5f82f5329a657467", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1babc9d2-6273-47fa-ac5b-f5d220c37ec1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "discover.pdf", "file_path": "discover.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11056931, "creation_date": "2024-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-13"}, "hash": "3d85cee9de970df7be00bf8cdb8b1f562ccb2cdb9d744015fca423025c215a50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) took part \nin the Battle of Britain and provided a high proportion of Commonwealth aircrew in bombers and fighter planes over Europe.

Canada remains a leading member of the Commonwealth to this day, together with other successor states of the Empire such as India, Australia, New Zealand, and several African and Caribbean countries.\nThe \u201cRoaring Twenties\u201d were boom times, \nwith prosperity for businesses and low unemployment. The stock market crash of 1929, however, led to the Great Depression or the \u201cDirty Thirties.\u201d Unemployment reached 27% in 1933 and many businesses were wiped out. Farmers in Western Canada were hit hardest by low grain prices and a terrible drought.\nThere was growing demand for the government to \ncreate a social safety net with minimum wages, a standard work week and programs such as unemployment insurance. The Bank of Canada, a central bank to manage the money supply and bring stability to the financial system, was created in 1934. Immigration dropped and many refugees were turned away, including Jews trying to flee Nazi Germany in 1939.\nThe Se COND  WORlD WAR\nThe Second World War began in 1939 when Adolf \nHitler, the National Socialist (Nazi) dictator of Germany, invaded Poland and conquered much of Europe. Canada joined with its democratic allies in the fight to defeat tyranny by force of arms.\nMore than one million Canadians and \nNewfoundlanders (Newfoundland was a separate British entity) served in the Second World War, out of a population of 11.5 million. This was a high proportion and of these, 44,000 were killed.\nThe Canadians fought bravely and suffered \nlosses in the unsuccessful defence of Hong Kong (1941) from attack by Imperial Japan, and in a failed raid on Nazi-controlled Dieppe on the coast of France (1942).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2033, "end_char_idx": 4160, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6984758-9b98-426b-a466-8ef4a1b969b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6984758-9b98-426b-a466-8ef4a1b969b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "discover.pdf", "file_path": "discover.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11056931, "creation_date": "2024-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-13"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae9864d8-a04f-49f3-a9be-b36959c7c9ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "discover.pdf", "file_path": "discover.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11056931, "creation_date": "2024-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-13"}, "hash": "879fad836d40f035ad175310330ee25d5c652e75fcbb861da1431b322ffca456", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d7ebfc2-2fed-4fca-ad7f-3315fd773b6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "discover.pdf", "file_path": "discover.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 11056931, "creation_date": "2024-10-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-13"}, "hash": "3712a5ddb494d824eb073232fe3b908d12a2a223e956b215a776077c82afdec4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) took part \nin the Battle of Britain and provided a high proportion of Commonwealth aircrew in bombers and fighter planes over Europe.

Quebec experienced an era of rapid change in the 1960s known as the Quiet Revolution. Many Quebecers sought to separate from Canada. In 1963 Parliament established the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism.

With the Communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975, many Vietnamese fled, including over 50,000 who sought refuge in Canada. \nThe idea of multiculturalism, as a result of  \n19th- and 20th-century immigration, gained a new \nimpetus.
