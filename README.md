## RAG in Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of language models by integrating retrieval mechanisms. It retrieves relevant documents or information from a large corpus and uses this retrieved data to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Steps to Create Agents and PDF RAG

### Simple PDF RAG (from `pdf.py`)
1. **Load PDF**: Use a PDF parser to extract text from the PDF document.
2. **Preprocess Text**: Clean and preprocess the extracted text for better retrieval and generation.
3. **Retrieve Relevant Information**: Implement a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant sections of the text based on the query.
4. **Generate Response**: Use a language model to generate responses based on the retrieved information.

### Advanced Agents (from `agents.py`)
1. **Initialize Agent**: Set up the agent with necessary configurations and tools.
2. **Load Data**: Load and preprocess data required for the agent's tasks.
3. **Implement Retrieval Engine**: Develop a custom retrieval engine using Pandas_Query or other tools to fetch relevant data.
4. **Generate Responses**: Use the language model to generate responses based on the retrieved data.
5. **Custom Functions**: Implement custom functions like note savers or code runners to enhance the agent's capabilities.
6. **Integration and Testing**: Integrate all components and test the agent to ensure it performs as expected.


By following these steps, you can create sophisticated agents that leverage RAG to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
